State whether the values match the description given in the table above.\nb. State the number of missing values in the column.\nc. Describe what you did to make values match the description if they did not\nmatch.\n\n## Solution\n\n**claim_id**\nThere were 2000 unique values that match the description given. There were no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**time_to_close**\nThere were 256 unique values that match the description given. There were no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**claim_amount**\nThere were 2000 unique values that match the description given. There were no missing values. If this column was to be used in the analysis, the following modifications would be completed: 1) remove _\"R$ \"_ from the beginning of each value, 2) cast each value in decimal format.\n\n**amount_paid**\nThere were 1964 unique values that match the description given. There were 36 missing values. The missing values were replaced with the median amount paid of the remaining data per the description (20105.70).\n\n**location**\nThere were 4 unique values (“RECIFE”, “SAO LUIS”, “FORTALEZA”, and “NATAL) that match the description given. There were no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**individuals_on_claim**\nThere were 15 unique values that match the description given. There were no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**linked_cases**\nThere were 3 unique values in this column: TRUE, FALSE, or missing. There were 26 missing values. All missing values were replaced with _FALSE_ per the description given.\n\n**cause**\nThere were 5 unique values in this column: \" Meat\", meat, vegetable, and VEGETABLES. There were no missing values. _\"VEGETABLES\"_ was replaced with _vegetable_ and _\" Meat\"_ was replaced with _meat_, per the description given.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Exploratory Analysis","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Ask\nCreate a visualization that shows the number of claims in each location. Use the\nvisualization to:\na. State which category of the variable location has the most observations\nb. Explain whether the observations are balanced across categories of the\nvariable location\n\n## Solution\n![Datacamp_Practical Exam Task 2_1](Datacamp_Practical%20Exam%20Task%202_1.jpg)\nThere are four possible locations included in the data. The two locations with the most food claims are Recife and Sao Luis. The food claim count is unbalanced for the four locations. 70% of claims in this analysis occurred at Recife or Sao Luis.\n\nThere are three possible food claim causes: meat, vegetables, or unknown. In the graphic below, the majority of food claims across all locations are caused by meat.\n![Datacamp_Practical Exam Task 2_2](Datacamp_Practical%20Exam%20Task%202_2.jpg)\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Ask\nDescribe the distribution of time to close for all claims. Your answer must include a visualization that shows the distribution.\n\n## Solution\nAs the legal team thinks that the time to close a food claim will be important, we should look at how the time to close a claim is distributed.\n\nLooking at the times to close a claim, we can see from the graphic below that most claims are closed between 140 and 230 days. The distribution is normally distributed. There are some outliers that close before 90 days or after 280 days, but this is uncommon.\n\n![Datacamp_Practical Exam Task 3](Datacamp_Practical%20Exam%20Task%203.jpg)","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Analysis & Insights","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Describe the relationship between time to close and location. Your answer must\ninclude a visualization to demonstrate the relationship\n\n## Solution\nLastly, we review the relationship between the time to close food claims and location. In the graph below, we see the outliers indicate that:\n-  the Sao Luis location closes food claims the longest of all locations,\n-  the Recife location closes food claims longer (than usual) more often.\n\n![Datacamp_Practical Exam Task 4_1](Datacamp_Practical%20Exam%20Task%204_1.jpg)\n\nIn the graph below, we see the time to close claims without outlier data. The interquartile ranges for each location are similar. The Recife location contains 44% of the total food claims in the dataset. Thus, this location would be a good location to begin identifying potential bottlenecks to improve food claim closing times.\n\n![Datacamp_Practical Exam Task 4_2](Datacamp_Practical%20Exam%20Task%204_2.jpg)\n","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
